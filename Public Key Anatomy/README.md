# OpenSSL RSA Public Key Anatomy
**This applies to RSA key only**. In this example I'm using a 512-bit public key. This is consider very insecure and should **never** be used in production.  
For RSA, when we say a *512-bit key*, it's the size of modulus, which is one component of the public and private key.  
The RSA Public Key is derived from the Private Key. We never generate a public key. We always generate a private key and that private key has the public key. They are both mathematically related.
## How big is a 512-bit key
Just to give you an idea of how large is a 512-bit number, it would look like:
1. ~154 decimal digits
2. 128 hexadeciaml digits

### How many decimal digits
If `n` is the number of digits, in base 10, you have to solve the equation 10<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup>

10<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup>  
n = log<sub>10(</sub>2<sup>512</sup>)  
n = 512 * log<sub>10</sub>2  
n â‰ˆ 154  
>Accoring to the **Laws of Exponents**:  
>log<sub>b</sub>(m<sup>r</sup>) = r ( log<sub>b</sub>m ) => log of `m` exponent `r` is `r` times `log of m`   

### How many hexadecimal digits
If `n` is the number of digits in base 16, you have to solve the equation 16<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup>

16<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup>  
n = log<sub>16(</sub>2<sup>512</sup>)  
n = 512 * log<sub>16</sub>2  
n = 128  
>If `n` is the number of digits in base 16, just divide the number of bits by 4, since every hexadeciaml digit is exactly 4 bits.  
## Fields
This following information are always included in the RSA public key file and in this order:
1. Modulus
2. Public Exponent

This applies to RSA public key only. It's based on a lot of readings, especially this [site](https://www.cem.me/20141221-cert-binaries.html) and a little bit of reverse engineering ðŸ˜€  

## Extract the Public Key from the Private Key
Use this command to extract the RSA public key from the private key:
```shell
openssl pkey -pubout -in private-key.pem -out public-key.pem
```
The file `public-key.pem` has the public key in `PEM` format. You can open it with any text editor.

>-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

## RSA Public Key in Hexadecimal
Lets convert the public key `PEM` file to hexadecimal. The `PEM` file is the base64 representation of the key. The idea is to convert the base64 file to binary and then convert the binary to readable hexadeciaml. Take a look at this script `pem2hex.sh` on my Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/ddella/d07d5b827f3638e727bbf3dc1210d4a2) to convert a `PEM` formatted file to hexadecimal.
Use the command to convert the file. The output is on stdout.
```shell
./pem2hex.sh public-key.pem
```
The public key in hexadecimal.

## RSA Public Key detail

Use this command to get the public key detail:
```shell
openssl pkey -pubin -text -noout -in public-key.pem
```
This command will output the same results as the preceding command but by reading the information from private key:
```shell
openssl pkey -text_pub -noout -in private-key.pem
```
The ouput of both commands is:
>````

The top left side of the table is the output of the preceding command. The top righ side of the table is the hexadecimal representation of the base64 PEM file.  
The bottom portion of the table represents the decoded values of every fields in an RSA public key.

To get the OID value from hexadecimal, I used a simple script by Matthias Gaertner found [here](https://www.rtner.de/software/oid.html) or on my Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/ddella/2c716646125912a6ef8bed6273f647f2)  
To compile, just use GCC/Apple clang:
```shell
gcc -Wall oid.c -o oid
```
To get the OID value, just type:
```shell
./oid -x 06092a864886f70d010101
```
The ouput should be:
```
UNIVERSAL OID.1.2.840.113549.1.1.1
```
## OID value representation
The representation of the OID was taken from Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpnap/ff1a8675-0008-408c-ba5f-686a10389adc)

## OpenSSL ASN.1 Parser
OpenSSL includes an ASN.1 parser. The numbers is the first column are in hexadecimal. They represent the byte offset of the binary public key file.
```shell
openssl asn1parse -inform pem -in public-key.pem -strparse 20
```
The output is:
>```
>  0:d=0  hl=2 l=  72 cons: SEQUENCE
>  2:d=1  hl=2 l=  65 prim: INTEGER       :CBE31732E90C8C8D22D65297455BF166714DB5247E28E960DC3DF0A9E2106D0A215E071D16B99450CA0354FAE77C5722723C45B>65055A969136E2F314757FFC9
>69:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER       :010001
>```
