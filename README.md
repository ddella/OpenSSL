# OpenSSL 3.0.7 - Nov 2022

## OpenSSL Cheat Sheet
OpenSSL is a versatile command line tool that can be used for a large variety of tasks related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to OpenSSL commands that are useful in everyday scenarios. This includes **OpenSSL** examples for generating private/public keys, certificate signing requests, and certificate format conversion.

All the example below have been tested with OpenSSL 3.x.y on a macOS but shoukld work without any problems on Linux or Windows.

Throughout the documents, I might used different file extensions. All the files are in `PEM` format, unless otherwise specified. The extension has no imptact on the file format.
