# ECC Private and Public Key Anatomy
**This applies to ECC key only**. In this example I'm using a 256-bit ECC key. This is considered very secure. It's the equivalent to an 3072-bit RSA key.  
The public key in ECC are EC points - pairs of integer coordinates {x, y}, laying on a curve.  
1.	Starting point on a curve
2.	Ending point on a curve  

The private key represents the number of hops on a curve to go from start to end. This number is almost impossible to guess.  

The ECC Public Key is derived from the Private Key. We never generate a public key. We always generate a private key and that private key has the public key. They are both mathematically related.  
## Advantages of ECC
1. With ECC you get equivalent cryptographic strength with significantly smaller key size
2. A smaller key size enable stronger security with faster TSL handshakes, which translates to better user experiance
3. Smaller certificate size translates to less information transfer on TLS negociation, lowering network overhead
4. Low on CPU consumption and memory usage for both client and server

The shorter key lengths mean devices require less processing power to encrypt and decrypt data, making ECC a good fit for mobile devices, Internet of Things, and other use cases with more limited computing power.
## How big is a 256-bit key
Just to give you an idea of how large is a 256-bit number, it would look like:
1. ~77 decimal digits
2. 64 hexadeciaml digits

### How many decimal digits
If `n` is the number of digits, in base 10, you have to solve the equation 10<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>256</sup>

10<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>256</sup>  
n = log<sub>10(</sub>2<sup>256</sup>)  
n = 256 * log<sub>10</sub>2  
n â‰ˆ 77  
>Accoring to the **Laws of Exponents**:  
>log<sub>b</sub>(m<sup>r</sup>) = r ( log<sub>b</sub>m ) => log of `m` exponent `r` is `r` times `log of m`  

### How many hexadecimal digits
If `n` is the number of digits in base 16, you have to solve the equation 16<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup>

16<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>256</sup>  
n = log<sub>16(</sub>2<sup>256</sup>)  
n = 256 * log<sub>16</sub>2  
n = 64  
>If `n` is the number of digits in base 16, just divide the number of bits by 4, since every hexadeciaml digit is exactly 4 bits.  
## Fields
There's way less information in an ECC key-pair than with RSA. The only information included are the Private, Public Keys and the OID to identify the type of keys.  
>This might not be accurate. Everything is based on a lots of reading and a bit of reverse engineering ðŸ˜€  
## ECC Private Key - PEM format
The first thing to do is to convert the private key `PEM`file to hexadecimal. The `PEM` file is the base64 representation of the key. For this example, I generated a 256-bit ECC private key.
>you never generate a public key  

To view the ECC Private Key in PEM (base64) format, just type:
```shell
cat ecc-private-key.pem
```
The output will look like this:
>```
>-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
>MHcCAQEEIKioNIShCCQg9DHzRfhfg/YpdklefcfMYguTy6Rb/sbooAoGCCqGSM49
>AwEHoUQDQgAEXhrbk2EX8sKScXgNTaiWpfrBA9xo1SgWwu7dxDkKVRtFe76Twv+4
>sSqzV4nUf7o+JJq6FNyufos7GlY2zjYcUQ==
>-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
>```
## ECC Private Key - Hexadecimal format
Convert the private key `PEM` file to hexadecimal.  
Check this script `pem2hex.sh` on my Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/ddella/d07d5b827f3638e727bbf3dc1210d4a2) to convert a `PEM` formatted file to hexadecimal.
```shell
./pem2hex.sh ecc-private-key.pem
```
The hexadeciaml representation of the `PEM` file:
```
30 77 02 01 01 04 20 a8 a8 34 84 a1 08 24 20 f4 31 f3 45 f8 5f 83 f6 29 76 49 5e 7d c7 cc 
62 0b 93 cb a4 5b fe c6 e8 a0 0a 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 03 01 07 a1 44 03 42 00 04 5e 1a db 
93 61 17 f2 c2 92 71 78 0d 4d a8 96 a5 fa c1 03 dc 68 d5 28 16 c2 ee dd c4 39 0a 55 1b 45 
7b be 93 c2 ff b8 b1 2a b3 57 89 d4 7f ba 3e 24 9a ba 14 dc ae 7e 8b 3b 1a 56 36 ce 36 1c 
51
```
I've colored the private and public key to show that the public key is included in the private key. This is exactly like the RSA private key.

## ECC Private Key detail
Use this command to get the ECC private key details:
```shell
openssl ec -in ecc-private-key.pem -noout -text
```
The top left side of the table is the output of the preceding command. The top righ side of the table is the hexadecimal representation of the base64 PEM file.  
The bottom portion of the table represents the decoded values of every fields in an ECC private key.  
![Alt text](/images/ecc-key-pair-detail.jpg "ECC key-pair detail")  
To get the OID value from hexadecimal, I used a simple script made by Matthias Gaertner found [here](https://www.rtner.de/software/oid.html) or on my Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/ddella/2c716646125912a6ef8bed6273f647f2)  
To compile, just use **GCC or Apple clang**:
```shell
gcc -Wall oid.c -o oid
```
To get the OID value, just type:
```shell
./oid -x 06082a8648ce3d030107 
```
The ouput should be:
```
UNIVERSAL OID.1.2.840.10045.3.1.7
```
>This is what I meant when I said *a bit of reverse engineering*. When decoding the file, I was left with some fields. I tried some numbers the get the OID value and found a match ðŸ˜‰  
## OID value representation
The representation of the OID was taken from Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpnap/ff1a8675-0008-408c-ba5f-686a10389adc)
![Alt text](/images/key-oid-ecc.jpg "Key pair OID")
## OpenSSL ASN.1 Parser
OpenSSL includes an ASN.1 parser. The numbers in the first column represent the byte offset of the binary private key file.
```shell
openssl asn1parse -inform pem -in ecc-private-key.pem
```
```
 0:d=0  hl=2 l= 119 cons: SEQUENCE
 2:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER       :01
 5:d=1  hl=2 l=  32 prim: OCTET STRING  [HEX DUMP]:A8A83484A1082420F431F345F85F83F62976495E7DC7CC620B93CBA45BFEC6E8
39:d=1  hl=2 l=  10 cons: cont [ 0 ]
41:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT        :prime256v1
51:d=1  hl=2 l=  68 cons: cont [ 1 ]
53:d=2  hl=2 l=  66 prim: BIT STRING
```
> Check [X.690 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690) for the ASN.1 tags
## Files
The file `ecc-private-key.pem` is the ECC private key.  
```shell
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ecc-private-key.pem
```
The file `ecc-private-key.bin` is the binary representation of the ECC private key `PEM` file.  
```shell
openssl enc -d -base64 -in ecc-private-key.pem -out ecc-private-key.bin
```
The file `ecc-public-key.pem` is the ECC public key extracted from the private key `PEM` file.  
```shell
openssl ec -in ecc-private-key.pem -pubout -out ecc-public-key.pem
```
The binary file is 121 bytes. According to the header in the hexadecimal dump of the private key `PEM` file, the size is 0x77 (119) bytes plus 2 bytes for the header and that equals to 121 bytes.
