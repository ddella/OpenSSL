# Digital Signature
A digital signature is an electronic signature. It provides an encrypted stamp of authentication and digital ID to confirm information originated from them. A signer's digital certificate is used to create the signature and then attach it to the signed document.

Digital signature provides:
1. **Authentication**: Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the identity of the source messages. A valid signature shows that the message was sent by a specific user.
2. **Integrity**: Assure that the message has not been altered during transmission. If a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after signature invalidates the signature.
3. **Non-repudiation**: An entity that has signed a message cannot at a later time deny having signed it.
